![logo](https://github.com/rodolfosotojr/la-z-Ltrs/blob/master/readme-logo.jpeg?raw=true)      *..Speak your sentiments*

## What our app does
A simplistic way of sending personalized, hand-written, notes to recipients that are deserving. Users will have the ability to use speech to text software for crafting note content, options to customize format and handwriting styles. Crafted letters will be in a format that handwrytten can ingest.

## Why our app is useful

Users can send handwritten letters quickly and cleanly by speaking or typing their sentiments. The app enables users to free their hands, keep concentration, reference historical note orders and socialize with other users by viewing their notes.

As Susan Lendroth said:
 *"To write is human, to receive a letter: Devine!"*
